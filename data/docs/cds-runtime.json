2020-07-22\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- `req.warn(code, msg, target, args)`\r\n- `req.data` returns an array in case of bulk operations\r\n- All services as subclasses of new `cds.Service`\r\n- Differentiation between \"Application Service\" (e.g., providing OData) and \"Persistence Service\" (e.g., database, remote)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Retrieve performance information via `sap-statistics` header in case of batch requests\r\n- Direct user authentication challenges in case of `/$batch`\r\n- HTTP error codes from custom handlers aren't filtered anymore if in 300...500 range\r\n- following projection with undefined name in target entity\r\n- Lists and null values in `where` with fluent expressions\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Streamlined `req.reject/error/info(code, msg, target, args)`: takes four individual params (number, string, string, array) or one object\r\n- Changed behavior by handler registration:\r\n  -- Handlers registered with entity = `*` aren't called by unbound events anymore.\r\n  -- Handlers registered without entity aren't called by bound events anymore.\r\n  -- Special case: Handlers registered in form .before/on/after(\\'\\*\\', handler) are called by bound and unbound events.\r\n- Expanding association from draft-enabled entity to draft enabled entities always provides active version of the expanded entity.\r\n- If you export a function in an `init.js` file, it will be called with the primary database, and its result is awaited.\r\n- REST: Since the service is now based on the `cds.Service` base class, all convenience functions (`create`, `post`, etc.) are streamlined.\r\n- Messaging: Only one queue per app is created, as opposed to one queue per app and external service.\r\n- Messaging: You can now directly connect to the (technical) messaging service through `await cds.connect.to('messaging')`, no topic names are generated here.\r\n- Messaging: If you want to link your own or external services to messaging, you need to model your events in CDS.\r\n- Messaging: If you want to provide custom topics for modeled events, you need to add the `@topic` annotation to the event.\r\n- Messaging: The `prefix` option in the service's credentials is prepended to events with a `@topic` annotation.\r\n- Messaging: The syntax to emit events with headers changed:\r\n  ```js\r\n  srv.emit({ event: 'yourEvent', data: { some: 'data' }, headers: { some: 'headers' } })\r\n  ```\r\n- Messaging: The default file for `file-based-messaging` is `~/.cds-msg-box`.\r\n- Streamlined handler registration: `srv.before/on/after(<event>, <entity>?, <handler>)`\r\n  - Event and handler are mandatory; entity must be omitted if unbound action/function (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE are considered to be bound)\r\n  - Event and entity may be arrayed\r\n  - `srv.before/on/after(*, <handler>)` matches all as shorthand\r\n- `INSERT` statements return an object or array of objects (in case of bulk) with the number of affected rows as result of `valueOf()`, as well as the keys of the inserted entities:\r\n  ```js\r\n  const res = await srv.run(\r\n    INSERT.into('Books').entries([\r\n      { ID: 1, title: 'one' },\r\n      { ID: 2, title: 'two' }\r\n    ])\r\n  )\r\n  res > 1 // > true\r\n  res.keys // > [{ ID: 1 }, { ID: 2 }]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Support for run block (`tx.run(() => {})`)\r\n\r\n## Version 2.0.3 - 2020-06-19\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Custom translatable error messages\r\n- Support for containment in CRUD\r\n- Support for static values in custom on conditions for associations\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- on() function for joins doesn't support the simple conditions like on(x, =, y) anymore. Only fluent expressions and object predicates are supported.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Enterprise Messaging: Received messages are correctly decoded\r\n- Reading single properties of draft enabled entities via navigations e. g. `/E0(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/e1(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/property`\r\n- Not supported transformation in `groupby` throws cryptic error\r\n- etag check only if OData request\r\n- Statements if path expression contains keys of type `cds.Timestamp`, `cds.DateTime` or `cds.Time`\r\n- `$filter` lambda `any` operator if no argument is provided\r\n- User attributes in `req.user.attr` merge `info.userInfo` and `info.userAttributes` (authentication strategy `JWT`)\r\n- User authentication challenges\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Support for nested user attributes in `@restrict.where`, e.g., `$user.name.familyName`\r\n\r\n## Version 2.0.2 - 2020-06-10\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Support for XSUAA's user attribute value `$UNRESTRICTED`\r\n- Default to combination `[...];IEEE754Compatible=true;ExponentialDecimals=true` if IEEE754Compatible or ExponentialDecimals is omitted\r\n- Use custom authenticate middleware via `cds.env.requires.auth.impl`\r\n- Authentication strategy `dummy` (`cds.env.requires.auth.strategy = 'dummy'`) that creates super users (i.e., pass all authorization checks)\r\n- Support relative destination path in rest-client\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- CQN returned for `req.query` changed — for requests with path expressions, the returned CQN of `req.query` is changed to a simplified format. For `GET /Authors(150)/books` the CQN contains the path in `.from` instead of an `exists` clause in `.where`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ SELECT:  {  from: { \"ref\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"AdminService.Authors\",\r\n          \"where\": [ { \"val\": 150 } ]\r\n        },\r\n      \"books\"\r\n      ] } } }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Authorizations as whitelist: if any restrictions exist for the target, all not explicitly allowed operations are forbidden (e.g., `@restrict: [{ grant: 'READ', ... }]` -> everything but `READ` is forbidden for all, including bound actions and functions)\r\n- Applicable `@requires` and `@restrict` definitions concatenated by AND\r\n- Reference to undefined XSUAA user attribute in `@restrict.where` results in forbidden\r\n- `req.event` for unbound actions and functions is provided without service prefix\r\n- Increased logging in production (temporarily until revised logging concept is implemented)\r\n- `cds.serve(..., { passport: [...] }` -> `cds.serve(..., { auth: [...] }`\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- `INSERT.into.as(SELECT.from...)` with `SELECT` containing placeholders\r\n- Requests on a navigation to many with key provided returns 404 if the resource doesn't exist\r\n- POST/PATCH requests on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key\r\n- Path expressions on SAP HANA are now flat and not structured anymore\r\n- `$expand` on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key\r\n- Roles from scopes including \".\"\r\n- Ignore unknown arrayed column during input validation\r\n- Too early client release\r\n- Pool configurations with default values can be set to `0`\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Support for annotation `@cds.persistence.name`\r\n- Deprecated SQL dialect `hdbcds`\r\n\r\n## Version 2.0.1 - 2020-05-20\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Passport strategies whitelist: `mock` and `JWT`\r\n- Authentication not needed for calls to a service's root or metadata endpoints\r\n- Support for \"public\" entities and actions (i.e., no restrictions) in services without `@requires` but other entities and/or actions with `@restrict`\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- `target` added to assert errors\r\n\r\n## Version 2.0.0 - 2020-05-20\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Update major version number\r\n\r\n## Version 1.2.0 - 2020-05-19\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- The timeout of the exclusive lock of drafts can now be configured using `cds.drafts.cancellationTimeout`\r\n- `req.params`: iterable with key-value pairs for the key predicates of the addressed resource\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Slightly improved performance for `$expand`\r\n- Return key values (single key only) of created entries instead of number of affected rows\r\n- Annotations `@cds.onInsert` and `@cds.onUpdate` ignore values from the request\r\n- Processing of read-only values moved to initial before handler\r\n- Aligned handling of virtual, computed, read-only, immutable with java runtime\r\n- Allow deep insert on to one association with nonkey property, the nonkey property is silently ignored\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Resolved some performance issues with `@sap/hana-client`\r\n- `$filter=false or ...` is now possible\r\n- Custom handler registration in multi-tenant scenario\r\n- Alias in associations wasn't processed correctly in post-processing\r\n- `$search` is now applied on the query result of `$apply` as specified in OData V4 spec\r\n- `evictionRunIntervalMillisForPools` is now treated properly\r\n- Searching for `_` or `%` in `$filter` queries with `contains`/`startswith`/`endswith`\r\n- Insert of to-one associations with structured elements\r\n\r\n## Version 1.1.1 - 2020-04-28\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Support for `orderBy` in rest-client\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- `limit` in CQN is translated to placeholders in SQL\r\n- QL API: .where() is changed:\r\n  -- Where with two parameters like .where('x', 1) isn't allowed and should be replaced with .where('x', '=', 1).\r\n  -- Combinations with partial CQNs like .where({ref: ['x']}, '=', 1) aren't allowed. Use arrays of partial CQNs like .where([ {ref: ['x']}, '=', {val: 1} ]) instead.\r\n  -- Fluent expressions work as strictly alternating string/value lists (as documented). Partial CQN can be used here as value.\r\n- Per default, results are now ordered by keys of the entity\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- `$filter=false or ...` is now possible\r\n- CREATE now returns `context.data` if not all non-UUID keys are provided\r\n  and no error is thrown in the database client\r\n- CANCEL and PATCH drafts now support multiple fields in where clauses\r\n- Handler registration for draft events in multitenancy scenario\r\n- Localize expanded entities\r\n- Composition and Association to one with expand in draft case\r\n- Disable local default pagination via `@cds.query.limit.default: 0`\r\n- Brackets in object predicates in where\r\n\r\n## Version 1.1.0 - 2020-04-23\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Support for CREATE operations with delegated key generation\r\n- `@cds.persistence.skip` annotated entities return HTTP code 501 in generic handlers\r\n- Introduced `@cds.localized:false` on entity-level for switching off automatic redirection to localized views\r\n- Server-side pagination on global, service, and entity-level via `@cds.query.limit`\r\n- Omitted key predicates of nested composition items are augmented, if possible\r\n- The exclusive lock of a draft automatically times out after 15 minutes\r\n- Static where annotations for RUD\r\n- Associations to one annotated with `@assert.integrity: false` are ignored on integrity checks\r\n- Support input validation annotations in ODATA\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Object notation in `.where` of statements doesn't allow functions anymore\r\n- `context.diff()` ignores `@cds.persistence.skip` annotated entities\r\n- Always try to read from localized views (also by draft enabled entities)\r\n- In multitenant scenario, the CSN model is now always loaded from `@sap/cds-mtx`. Previously, it was only loaded if it was extended.\r\n- Use open source version of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core`\r\n- If a column or column alias is used multiple times in a SELECT query, the query is from now on rejected. Example: `SELECT.from(Foo).columns(['c1', 'c1'])`\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Reference integrity checks for foreign entities without stored keys\r\n- Calculation of `HasActiveEntity`\r\n- Update and Delete with where annotations\r\n- Aliases by navigation with complex where annotation\r\n- `req._.res` is express' ServerResponse\r\n- SQL Error in case of `$filter` using `ne` operator in combination with `$search`\r\n- Deep update with immutable fields in child entities\r\n- Draft union scenario in case of DraftAdministrativeData navigation\r\n- Transaction handling inside `$batch` requests\r\n- Multiple aliases in `SELECT.columns`\r\n- Use `hdb` if in direct dependencies of app (and `@sap/hana-client` isn't)\r\n- Mapping over a result propagates `$count`\r\n- Don't ignore rows with `null` column values in negated `$search` queries\r\n\r\n# Changelog History\r\n\r\nThe CDS Runtime module is the successor of `@sap/cds-services`, `@sap/cds-messaging`, `@sap/cds-rest`, `@sap/cds-hana`, `@sap/cds-sqlite`, and `@sap/cds-sql`.

Each original URI path segment has a\r\ncorresponding UriResource path segment after parsing the URI.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst UriParser = require('./lib/uri/UriParser');\r\nconst edm = getEdmProviderInstanceSomehow();\r\nconst uriParser = new UriParser(edm);\r\n\r\nconst uriInfo = uriParser.parseRelativeUri(\r\n    \"/YourEntitySetName(KeyName=1,Key2Name='2')/YourNavigationProperty/AnyProperty\",\r\n    queryOptions);  // only used for aliases\r\n\r\nuriInfo.getPathSegments() // --> [UriResource, UriResource, UriResource]\r\n\r\n// First path segment\r\nconst first = uriInfo.getPathSegments()[0]; // Returns UriResource\r\nfirst.getKind() // --> UriResource.ResourceKind.ENTITY\r\nfirst.getEntitySet() // --> EdmEntitySet\r\nfirst.getKeyPredicates() // --> [UriParameter, UriParameter]\r\nfirst.getKeyPredicates()[1].getValue() // --> '2'\r\nfirst.getKeyPredicates()[1].getEdmRef() // --> Returns the corresponding edm reference object\r\n\r\n// Second path segment\r\nconst second = uriInfo.getPathSegments()[1]; // Returns UriResource\r\nsecond.getKind() // --> UriResource.ResourceKind.NAVIGATION_TO_[ONE|MANY]\r\nsecond.getNavigationProperty() // --> EdmNavigationProperty\r\nsecond.getTarget() // --> The target of the navigation\r\n\r\n// Third path segment\r\nconst third = uriInfo.getPathSegments()[2]; // Returns UriResource\r\nthird.getKind() // --> UriResource.ResourceKind.[PRIMITIVE|COMPLEX|COMPLEX_COLLECTION|...]_PROPERTY\r\nthird.getProperty() // --> EdmProperty\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Filter Query Option\r\n\r\nAccessing the filter query option gets the root node of the filter\r\nexpression tree.\r\n\r\n## Orderby Query Option\r\n\r\nAccessing the orderby query option gets an array of orderby-item objects.\r\nEach of these objects can be queried for the root of its expression tree and\r\nfor the sorting direction.\r\n\r\n## Expand Query Option\r\n\r\nAccessing the expand query option gets an array of expand-item objects.\r\nEach of these objects can be queried for its path segments, whether all\r\nnavigation properties have to be expanded, and for options.\r\n\r\n## Select Query Option\r\n\r\nAccessing the select query option gets an array of select-item objects.\r\nEach of these objects can be queried for its path segments, whether all\r\nproperties have been selected, and whether all operations in a schema\r\nnamespace have been selected (in this case the namespace also can be\r\nretrieved).\r\n\r\n## Search Query Option\r\n\r\nAccessing the search query option gets the root node of the search expression\r\ntree. Three different kinds of nodes are possible: binary-expression nodes\r\n(where only AND and OR operators can occur), unary-expression nodes (where\r\nonly NOT is possible as operator) and literal nodes.\r\n\r\n## Expressions\r\n\r\n### Expression Kinds\r\n\r\nThere are different kinds of expressions. Each kind of expression is\r\nimplemented in a separate class with specialized access methods. But all have\r\na method to get their EDM type.\r\n\r\n### Literal Expression\r\n\r\nA literal expression represents a literal directly written in the expression.\r\n\r\n### Alias Expression\r\n\r\nAn alias expression represents a parameter alias. Written as an at-sign\r\nfollowed by an identifier, it represents a reference to an expression given\r\nas separate query option in the URI. The alias expression has a method to\r\naccess this referenced expression.\r\n\r\n### Unary Expression\r\n\r\nA unary expression represents an OData built-in unary operator.\r\nIts operand (an expression) can be accessed as well.\r\n\r\n### Binary Expression\r\n\r\nA binary expression represents an OData built-in binary operator.\r\nIts left and right operands (also expressions) can be accessed as well.\r\n\r\n### Method Expression\r\n\r\nA method expression represents an OData built-in method. Its parameters\r\n(which can in turn be expressions) can be accessed as well.\r\n\r\n### Member Expression\r\n\r\nA member expression represents a path expression to access, in the easiest\r\ncase, a member property of the entity the expression refers to. It has a\r\nmethod to access the URI resource elements the path consists of.\r\n\r\n### Type Literal Expression\r\n\r\nA type-literal expression represents a type name written literally in the\r\nexpression, used in the built-in type-related methods. A type cast used in\r\na path (member expression) does not result in a type-literal expression.\r\n"}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"name":"README.md","content":"# @sap/cds-runtime\r\nThis package is no longer maintained.
