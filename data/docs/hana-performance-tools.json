This repository will be the only single source for the development plan, code, development status, release information, downloadable package, analysis know-hows, and bug reporting.\r\n\r\n## Why Another SQL Analysis Tool?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you might have a question why we are developing another tool in addtion to the existing PlanViz in Studio and SQL Analyzer in HANA Cockpit.

So, VSCode extension app can be plugged into new WebIDE, which is aligned with new developer tooling strategy for both cloud and on-prem.\r\n- PlanViz has been built in 2011, and it required big refactoring to accomodate multiple SQL engines. We decided to build from the scratch for this major change.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nSQL Analyzer for Visual Studio Code is still under heavy development. Here are some highlighted features:\r\n\r\n- Live connection support (Note: connection details will be stored in [SecretStorage](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_53#_secrets-api).)\r\n- Load multiple PLV files and keep the history\r\n- Visualize query plans in PLV into plan graph\r\n- Quick analysis support\r\n- Critical path visualization\r\n- Bookmark and sharing (Note: Personal data can be anonymized and the comments can be deleted by users.)\r\n- Recommendations\r\n- SQL Plan Execution Monitor for real-time analysis\r\n- Advanced UX\r\n\r\n## How To Install\r\n\r\n1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) if not installed already (>= 1.53.0 is required because the extension is relying on the APIs from that version).\r\n1. Open VSCode and click Extensions tab (puzzle icon) from the left side menu bar\r\n1.

Once the installation is completed, the new SQL Analyzer icon will be added in the left side menu.\r\n\r\n## How To Use\r\n\r\n1.
