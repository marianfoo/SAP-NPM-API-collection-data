To use this module we recommend to install [@sap/cds-dk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-dk) globally.\r\n\r\nSee the [CDS Linting documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/tools/#cds-lint) for more details, or jump directly to a complete [list of rules](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/tools/#cds-lint-rules). CAP provides a set of recommended rules. On top, you can create your own, application-specific rules.\r\n"}]
