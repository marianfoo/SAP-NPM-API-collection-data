[{"name":"ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md","content":"<!--\r\nThank you for reporting an issue about fibers. Please make sure you've read the first section of the README because it contains valuable information about common issues.\r\n\r\nSome common issues:\r\n\r\n- If you are having problems with an odd-numbered version of nodejs please try again with an even-numbered version instead. The nodejs team doesn't do a good job of communicating this but odd-numbered versions are basically beta versions.\r\n\r\n- If you are having problems with a Meteor project please stop right now and go read their documentation. You most likely are trying to use a version of nodejs that is not supported by Meteor.\r\n\r\n- Find the npm version badge on the front page of this project's github. If the version of fibers you're trying to install is not the latest version then please stop and update your dependencies to require the latest version. This often happens when attempting to install another npm module which depends on fibers.\r\n\r\n- If your error says \"Can't wait without a fiber\" then please go read the documentation again. You need a top-level Fiber or Future before calling `wait`.\r\n\r\n- If you're using Webpack then don't. Fibers can't be used with Webpack.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf none of these apply then feel free to open a ticket with a bug report or question. PLEASE INCLUDE ENOUGH INFORMATION IN YOUR REPORT. You are a software engineer! Ask yourself: \"if someone was reporting an issue about something that I wrote what information would be helpful?\". That is, please include your nodejs version, your operating system version, your compiler version, what you've tried so far to fix the issue.. things like that. If some specific code is triggering the issue then please include a full example of the code that can be run on its own. Please no \"snippets\", if I can't run the code without modifications then I can't help you.\r\n-->\r\n"},{"name":"README.md","content":"fibers(1) -- Fiber support for v8 and Node\r\n==========================================\r\n[![npm version](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/v/fibers)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers)\r\n[![isc license](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/license/fibers)](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n[![travis build](https://badgen.now.sh/travis/laverdet/node-fibers)](https://travis-ci.org/laverdet/node-fibers)\r\n[![npm downloads](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/dm/fibers)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers)\r\n\r\nFibers, sometimes called [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), are a powerful tool which expose an API to jump between multiple call stacks from within a single thread. This can be useful to make code written for a synchronous library play nicely in an asynchronous environment.\r\n\r\nINSTALLING\r\n----------\r\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/fibers.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers)\r\n\r\n### via npm\r\n* `npm install fibers`\r\n* You're done! (see \"supported platforms\" below if you run into errors)\r\n\r\n### from source\r\n* `git clone git://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers.git`\r\n* `cd node-fibers`\r\n* `npm install`\r\n\r\nNote: node-fibers uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) for\r\nbuilding. To manually invoke the build process, you can use `node-gyp rebuild`.\r\nThis will put the compiled extension in `build/Release/fibers.node`. However,\r\nwhen you do `require('fibers')`, it will expect the module to be in, for\r\nexample, `bin/linux-x64-v8-3.11/fibers.node`. You can manually put the module\r\nhere every time you build, or you can use the included build script. Either\r\n`npm install` or `node build -f` will do this for you. If you are going to be\r\nhacking on node-fibers, it may be worthwhile to first do `node-gyp configure`\r\nand then for subsequent rebuilds you can just do `node-gyp build` which will\r\nbe faster than a full `npm install` or `node-gyp rebuild`.\r\n\r\n### meteor users please read this\r\nIf you're trying to get meteor running and you ended up at this page you're\r\nprobably doing something wrong. Please uninstall all versions of NodeJS and\r\nMeteor, then start over. See\r\n[meteor#5124](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5124) for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n### supported platforms\r\nIf you are running 64-bit nodejs version 12.x or 14.x on Linux, OS X, or Windows (7 or later) then\r\nyou should be able to install fibers from npm just fine. If you are running nodejs v10.x then you\r\nwill need to use `npm install fibers@4`. Older versions of nodejs will require older and older\r\nversion of fibers.\r\n\r\n(special thanks to [Jeroen Janssen](https://github.com/japj) for his work on fibers in Windows)\r\n\r\nIf you do end up needing to compile fibers first make sure you have node-gyp installed as a global\r\ndependency (`npm install -g node-gyp`), and that you have setup your build environment by following\r\nthe instructions at [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp). Ubuntu-flavored Linux users\r\nmay need to run `sudo apt-get install g++` as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe examples below describe basic use of `Fiber`, but note that it is **not\r\nrecommended** to use `Fiber` without an abstraction in between your code and\r\nfibers. See \"FUTURES\" below for additional information.\r\n\r\n### Sleep\r\nThis is a quick example of how you can write sleep() with fibers. Note that\r\nwhile the sleep() call is blocking inside the fiber, node is able to handle\r\nother events.\r\n\r\n\t$ cat sleep.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Fiber = require('fibers');\r\n\r\nfunction sleep(ms) {\r\n\tvar fiber = Fiber.current;\r\n\tsetTimeout(function() {\r\n\t\tfiber.run();\r\n\t}, ms);\r\n\tFiber.yield();\r\n}\r\n\r\nFiber(function() {\r\n\tconsole.log('wait... ' + new Date);\r\n\tsleep(1000);\r\n\tconsole.log('ok... ' + new Date);\r\n}).run();\r\nconsole.log('back in main');\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t$ node sleep.js\r\n\twait... Fri Jan 21 2011 22:42:04 GMT+0900 (JST)\r\n\tback in main\r\n\tok... Fri Jan 21 2011 22:42:05 GMT+0900 (JST)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Incremental Generator\r\nYielding execution will resume back in the fiber right where you left off. You\r\ncan also pass values back and forth through yield() and run(). Again, the node\r\nevent loop is never blocked while this script is running.\r\n\r\n\t$ cat generator.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Fiber = require('fibers');\r\n\r\nvar inc = Fiber(function(start) {\r\n\tvar total = start;\r\n\twhile (true) {\r\n\t\ttotal += Fiber.yield(total);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n\r\nfor (var ii = inc.run(1); ii <= 10; ii = inc.run(1)) {\r\n\tconsole.log(ii);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t$ node generator.js\r\n\t1\r\n\t2\r\n\t3\r\n\t4\r\n\t5\r\n\t6\r\n\t7\r\n\t8\r\n\t9\r\n\t10\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fibonacci Generator\r\nExpanding on the incremental generator above, we can create a generator which\r\nreturns a new Fibonacci number with each invocation. You can compare this with\r\nthe [ECMAScript Harmony\r\nGenerator](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators) Fibonacci\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\t$ cat fibonacci.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Fiber = require('fibers');\r\n\r\n// Generator function. Returns a function which returns incrementing\r\n// Fibonacci numbers with each call.\r\nfunction Fibonacci() {\r\n\t// Create a new fiber which yields sequential Fibonacci numbers\r\n\tvar fiber = Fiber(function() {\r\n\t\tFiber.yield(0); // F(0) -> 0\r\n\t\tvar prev = 0, curr = 1;\r\n\t\twhile (true) {\r\n\t\t\tFiber.yield(curr);\r\n\t\t\tvar tmp = prev + curr;\r\n\t\t\tprev = curr;\r\n\t\t\tcurr = tmp;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n\t// Return a bound handle to `run` on this fiber\r\n\treturn fiber.run.bind(fiber);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Initialize a new Fibonacci sequence and iterate up to 1597\r\nvar seq = Fibonacci();\r\nfor (var ii = seq(); ii <= 1597; ii = seq()) {\r\n\tconsole.log(ii);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t$ node fibonacci.js\r\n\t0\r\n\t1\r\n\t1\r\n\t2\r\n\t3\r\n\t5\r\n\t8\r\n\t13\r\n\t21\r\n\t34\r\n\t55\r\n\t89\r\n\t144\r\n\t233\r\n\t377\r\n\t610\r\n\t987\r\n\t1597\r\n\r\n\r\n### Basic Exceptions\r\nFibers are exception-safe; exceptions will continue travelling through fiber\r\nboundaries:\r\n\r\n\t$ cat error.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Fiber = require('fibers');\r\n\r\nvar fn = Fiber(function() {\r\n\tconsole.log('async work here...');\r\n\tFiber.yield();\r\n\tconsole.log('still working...');\r\n\tFiber.yield();\r\n\tconsole.log('just a little bit more...');\r\n\tFiber.yield();\r\n\tthrow new Error('oh crap!');\r\n});\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n\twhile (true) {\r\n\t\tfn.run();\r\n\t}\r\n} catch(e) {\r\n\tconsole.log('safely caught that error!');\r\n\tconsole.log(e.stack);\r\n}\r\nconsole.log('done!');\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t$ node error.js\r\n\tasync work here...\r\n\tstill working...\r\n\tjust a little bit more...\r\n\tsafely caught that error!\r\n\tError: oh crap!\r\n\t\t\tat error.js:11:9\r\n\tdone!\r\n\r\n\r\nFUTURES\r\n-------\r\n\r\nUsing the `Fiber` class without an abstraction in between your code and the raw\r\nAPI is **not recommended**. `Fiber` is meant to implement the smallest amount of\r\nfunctionality in order make possible many different programming patterns. This\r\nmakes the `Fiber` class relatively lousy to work with directly, but extremely\r\npowerful when coupled with a decent abstraction. There is no right answer for\r\nwhich abstraction is right for you and your project. Included with `node-fibers`\r\nis an implementation of \"futures\" which is fiber-aware. Usage of this library\r\nis documented below. There are several other externally-maintained options\r\nwhich can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers/wiki).\r\nYou **should** feel encouraged to be creative with fibers and build a solution\r\nwhich works well with your project. For instance, `Future` is not a good\r\nabstraction to use if you want to build a generator function (see Fibonacci\r\nexample above).\r\n\r\nUsing `Future` to wrap existing node functions. At no point is the node event\r\nloop blocked:\r\n\r\n\t$ cat ls.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Future = require('fibers/future');\r\nvar fs = Future.wrap(require('fs'));\r\n\r\nFuture.task(function() {\r\n\t// Get a list of files in the directory\r\n\tvar fileNames = fs.readdirFuture('.').wait();\r\n\tconsole.log('Found '+ fileNames.length+ ' files');\r\n\r\n\t// Stat each file\r\n\tvar stats = [];\r\n\tfor (var ii = 0; ii < fileNames.length; ++ii) {\r\n\t\tstats.push(fs.statFuture(fileNames[ii]));\r\n\t}\r\n\tstats.map(function(f) {\r\n\t\tf.wait()\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\t// Print file size\r\n\tfor (var ii = 0; ii < fileNames.length; ++ii) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(fileNames[ii]+ ': '+ stats[ii].get().size);\r\n\t}\r\n}).detach();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t$ node ls.js \r\n\tFound 11 files\r\n\tbin: 4096\r\n\tfibers.js: 1708\r\n\t.gitignore: 37\r\n\tREADME.md: 8664\r\n\tfuture.js: 5833\r\n\t.git: 4096\r\n\tLICENSE: 1054\r\n\tsrc: 4096\r\n\tls.js: 860\r\n\tMakefile: 436\r\n\tpackage.json: 684\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future API is designed to make it easy to move between classic\r\ncallback-style code and fiber-aware waiting code:\r\n\r\n\t$ cat sleep.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Future = require('fibers/future'), wait = Future.wait;\r\n\r\n// This function returns a future which resolves after a timeout. This\r\n// demonstrates manually resolving futures.\r\nfunction sleep(ms) {\r\n\tvar future = new Future;\r\n\tsetTimeout(function() {\r\n\t\tfuture.return();\r\n\t}, ms);\r\n\treturn future;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// You can create functions which automatically run in their own fiber and\r\n// return futures that resolve when the fiber returns (this probably sounds\r\n// confusing.. just play with it to understand).\r\nvar calcTimerDelta = function(ms) {\r\n\tvar start = new Date;\r\n\tsleep(ms).wait();\r\n\treturn new Date - start;\r\n}.future(); // <-- important!\r\n\r\n// And futures also include node-friendly callbacks if you don't want to use\r\n// wait()\r\ncalcTimerDelta(2000).resolve(function(err, val) {\r\n\tconsole.log('Set timer for 2000ms, waited '+ val+ 'ms');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\t$ node sleep.js\r\n\tSet timer for 2000ms, waited 2009ms\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI DOCUMENTATION\r\n-----------------\r\nFiber's definition looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/**\r\n * Instantiate a new Fiber.

This is implemented by causing\r\nyield() to throw unconditionally when the library is trying to unwind your\r\nfiber-- either because reset() was called, or all handles to the fiber were lost\r\nand v8 wants to delete it.\r\n\r\nSomething like this will, at some point, cause an infinite loop in your\r\napplication:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fiber = Fiber(function() {\r\n\twhile (true) {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tFiber.yield();\r\n\t\t} catch(e) {}\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\nfiber.run();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you either call reset() on this fiber, or the v8 garbage collector decides it\r\nis no longer in use, the fiber library will attempt to unwind the fiber by\r\ncausing all calls to yield() to throw. However, if you catch these exceptions\r\nand continue anyway, an infinite loop will occur.\r\n\r\nThere are other garbage collection issues that occur with misuse of fiber\r\nhandles. If you grab a handle to a fiber from within itself, you should make\r\nsure that the fiber eventually unwinds. This application will leak memory:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fiber = Fiber(function() {\r\n\tvar that = Fiber.current;\r\n\tFiber.yield();\r\n}\r\nfiber.run();\r\nfiber = undefined;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no way to get back into the fiber that was started, however it's\r\nimpossible for v8's garbage collector to detect this. With a handle to the fiber\r\nstill outstanding, v8 will never garbage collect it and the stack will remain in\r\nmemory until the application exits.\r\n\r\nThus, you should take care when grabbing references to `Fiber.current`.\r\n"}]
