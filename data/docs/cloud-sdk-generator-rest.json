[{"name":"CHANGELOG.md","content":"# Change Log\r\n\r\nAll notable changes to this module will be documented centrally in the [SAP Cloud SDK release notes](https://help.sap.com/doc/9dbcab0600b346c2b359a8c8978a45ba/1.0/en-US/index.html).\r\n"},{"name":"README.md","content":"## REST Generator\r\n\r\nThis is currently not release ready. excluded in `mail.ts`.\r\n\r\nThe generator wraps only the openapi-generator. \r\nThis is a flexible tool using many commandline flags and templates for easy adjustment.\r\n<br>[Command line arguments](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#3---usage)\r\n<br>[Repo For mustache files](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/typescript-axios)\r\n\r\nIn the wrapping `generator-cli` we currently only expose `inputDir` and `outputDir` to generate tyescript-axios sources from the openapi.json files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Things we have adjusted to the OpenApi Generator\r\n- Since the SAP graph definitions were lacking any tags we added a tag with the service name in camel case to each path of the service.\r\n- The method singature of the constructor was changed to take the accesstoken or basic for auth  and URL. \r\n  This was done by changing the `templates/baseApi.mustache` to achieve that.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo run the generator use:\r\n \r\n ```shell script\r\n ts-node `src/generator-cli.ts` -i <FolderContainingOpenApiDefinitions> -o <OutputDirectory>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have the generated classes, you can make calls via:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { AxiosResponse } from 'axios';\r\nimport { SalesOrdersApi, InlineResponse200 as ResponseSalesOrder } from 'generated/sales-orders';\r\n\r\nconst response: AxiosResponse<ResponseSalesOrder> = await new SalesOrdersApi({ accessToken, basePath }).getSalesOrders()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides bearer token also basic is supported for authentication.\r\n\r\n### Problem Generator\r\n\r\n- If you add the option `'--additional-properties=withSeparateModelsAndApi=true'`\r\nand you have the templates enables, the model files are empty. Most likely there is no template found for the type.\r\n"}]
