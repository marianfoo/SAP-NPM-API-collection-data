The tasks can be added to the application or library project as custom tasks.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFirst of all, declare the dependency to this project in the package.json of the application or library:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"ui5-builder-webide-extension\": \"^1.0.0\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of today, the custom tasks need to be added to the `dependencies` section rather than to the `devDependencies` section.\r\n\r\nNow, you can add the custom tasks to the `ui5.yaml` of the application or library:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspecVersion: '1.0'\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: my-app\r\ntype: application\r\nbuilder:\r\n    customTasks:\r\n    - name: simpleTask\r\n      afterTask: replaceVersion\r\n    - name: otherTask\r\n      afterTask: simpleTask\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `simpleTask` will be added after the `replaceVersion` and the `otherTask` will be executed after the `simpleTask`.\r\n"}]
