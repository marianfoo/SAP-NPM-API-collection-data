Open your SAP BAS instance\r\n2. Create a new Basic dev space\r\n3. Open the folder `home/user/projects` in a terminal and `git clone` this repository (for issues with user authentication see [BAS help on Connect to Your Git Source Control System](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/e7a42bcb9d124b43be7e396b11d5e808.html)\r\n4. Go into your repo in the terminal and run `npm i`\r\n5. Run `npm run build`\r\n6. Run `npm link`\r\n7. When ready refresh the SAP BAS window\r\n8. To open the yeoman-ui: View => Find Command … => Open Template Wizard _(Currently console prompt mode is not supported)_\r\n\r\nIn case you have changes that you need to apply run `npm unlink` and then execute steps 5 ans 6\r\n\r\n## Debugging\r\n### Steps to prepare your BAS (one time for devspace):\r\n1. In terminal: `npm i -g generator-code`\r\n2. Create a fake debug project as entry point to your project => in terminal: `yo code` (choose default answers in all your steps, remember its name)\r\n3. Download latest vsix of yeoman-ui: (https://github.com/SAP/yeoman-ui/releases)\r\n4. Create folder: /home/user/default-plugins\r\n5. Copy the downloaded vsix into the \"default-plugins\" folder\r\n6. Stop and start the devspace\r\n\r\n### Steps to debug:\r\n1. Put break points in the code of generator-adaptationproject-creation accordingly (click on the left hand-side next to the corresponding line)\r\n2. From Command pallete run \"Hosted Plugin: Debug Instance\"\r\n4. Choose the name of your extension folder you have created with \"yo code\" in step 2 in \"Steps to prepare your BAS\"\r\n5. A new BAS instance opens in a new tab and there run View => Find Command … => Open Template Wizard\r\n6. Crete a new adaptation project to run the creation generator\r\n7. Go to the first BAS instance and see that it has stopped to your break points\r\n\r\n### Debugging fine tuning\r\n(in case the break points only in .js-files are fired but not in .ts- files then)\r\n1. Create a launch.json in the .vscode folder in home/user/projects\r\n2. Add the following configuration:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t// Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.\r\n\t// Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.\r\n\t\"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n\t\"configurations\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"node\",\r\n\t\t\t\"request\": \"attach\",\r\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Attach generator debugger\",\r\n\t\t\t\"port\": 9229\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Attach to the process by going to the Debug tab (leftmost pane, icon with a bug), selecting the `Attach generator debugger` configuration and pressing `Start debugging`\r\n\r\n"}]
